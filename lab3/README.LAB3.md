Walmart Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Walmart Sales dataset. The analysis follows the standard machine learning workflow: data cleaning, statistical inspection, and visual pattern recognition to understand the factors affecting weekly sales.📋 Project OverviewThe goal of this analysis is to evaluate how different external factors—such as holidays, temperature, fuel prices, and economic indicators (CPI, Unemployment)—impact the weekly sales performance across 45 different Walmart stores.📊 Dataset DescriptionThe dataset used is Walmart_Sales.csv, which contains historical sales data from 2010 to 2012.ColumnDescriptionStoreThe store number ID.DateThe week of sales.Weekly_SalesSales for the given store in that week.Holiday_FlagWhether the week is a special holiday week (1) or not (0).TemperatureTemperature on the day of sale.Fuel_PriceCost of fuel in the region.CPIConsumer Price Index.UnemploymentPrevailing unemployment rate.🚀 Key Analysis StepsThe analysis is conducted in the Walmart_Analysis.ipynb notebook and covers:Data Cleaning: Checking for missing values, duplicates, and converting date strings into datetime objects.Statistical Profiling: Generating descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for all numeric variables.Univariate Analysis: Plotting histograms to understand the distribution of sales and environmental factors.Bivariate Analysis: Using scatter plots and bar charts to compare sales against variables like Temperature and Store IDs.Multivariate Analysis: Creating a correlation heatmap to identify which features most strongly influence sales.Time Series Analysis: Visualizing monthly revenue trends to identify seasonality.🛠️ RequirementsTo run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:pandasnumpymatplotlibseabornYou can install them via pip:Bashpip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
📖 How to UseEnsure Walmart_Sales.csv and Walmart_Analysis.ipynb are in the same directory.Open your terminal or command prompt.Launch Jupyter Notebook:Bashjupyter notebook
Run all cells in Walmart_Analysis.ipynb to generate the plots and analysis results.📉 Summary of FindingsSeasonality: Sales show significant peaks during the end-of-year holiday seasons.Store Performance: There is high variance in revenue between different store locations.Correlations: While economic factors like CPI and Unemployment show trends, they have complex relationships with weekly sales that vary by region.
